In this lab, I gained practical experience using Git to manage a professional web development workflow, starting with the initialization of a local repository and connecting it to GitHub. I learned how to create and track various files, such as index.html and .gitignore, while using commits to save specific versions of my progress. A key highlight was working with branching, which allowed me to create an "experiment" branch to test new HTML features without affecting the stability of my main project. Finally, I practiced merging these branches to incorporate my successful changes back into the master branch, ensuring a clean and organized project history
